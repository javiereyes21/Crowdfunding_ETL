Crowdfunding-ETL Miniproject

Creator: Javier Reyes

This project involves building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for a crowdfunding dataset. 
The goal is to extract crowdfunding campaign data, transform it to make it more structured and consistent, and load it into a database for analysis. 
This pipeline facilitates better insights and data-driven decision-making for crowdfunding campaigns.
